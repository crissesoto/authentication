# Secrets Keeper

## Description

Secrets keeper is a really simple concept, it allows people to submit their secrets anonymously so wherever they post are not associated with a email
or a user name and it means that people can express themselves I guess more freely. 
You can either go towards register or go towards log in and once the user has been registered or logged in and they have been authenticated then they
are able to access the secrets page.
